          <h2>TEAM HISTORY</h2>
          <p>
            The Edmonton Oilers are a professional ice hockey team based in
            Edmonton. They compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a
            member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Oilers
            were officially founded in 1971 by W. D. "Wild Bill" Hunter and Dr.
            Chuck Allard. The team played its first season in 1972, as one of
            the twelve founding franchises of the major professional World
            Hockey Association (WHA). They were originally intended to be one of
            two WHA Alberta teams, along with the Calgary Broncos. However, when
            the Broncos relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, before the WHA's first
            season began, the Oilers were renamed the Alberta Oilers. They
            returned to their current name in the following year, and
            subsequently joined the NHL in 1979 as one of four franchises
            absorbed through the NHL merger with the WHA. After joining the NHL,
            the Oilers went on to win the Stanley Cup on five occasions:
            1983–84, 1984–85, 1986–87, 1987–88 and 1989–90. Along with the
            Pittsburgh Penguins, they are tied for the most championships won by
            any team since the NHL-WHA merger and also the most won by any team
            that joined the league in or after 1967. Among all NHL teams, only
            the Montreal Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup more times since the
            League's 1967 expansion. For their success in the 1980s, the Oilers
            team of this era has been honoured with dynasty status by the Hockey
            Hall of Fame. However, the Oilers began to struggle greatly shortly
            after the 2004–05 NHL lockout, having missed the playoffs every year
            since 2006, with the exception of 2016–17 and 2019–20. The Oilers
            have drafted 12 first round selections since 2007, 10 of which were
            within the first 10 draft choices overall, 6 of those picks were
            within the first 4 picks overall, and 4 of those 6 were first
            overall selections. In the NHL Entry Draft, Edmonton selected first
            overall Taylor Hall, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Nail Yakupov and Connor
            McDavid with those picks; only McDavid and Nugent-Hopkins remain
            with the Oilers today. The Oilers are one of two NHL franchises
            based in Alberta; the other being the Calgary Flames. Their close
            proximity to each other has led to a fierce rivalry known as the
            "Battle of Alberta".
